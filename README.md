# GreenPredict
 Forest Cover Type Prediction App  Purpose: This app uses a decision tree model to predict the forest cover type based on various environmental features. It provides an interactive platform for users to input data and receive predictions on the type of forest cover, aiding in forest management and research.  Impact: The app offers a user-friendly tool to apply machine learning for forest cover classification. It helps individuals and organizations make informed decisions about forest areas by providing an easily interpretable classification based on environmental characteristics. By making complex predictions accessible, it enables non-experts to understand and engage with forest cover data.  Key Features:  Input environmental features to predict forest cover type. Uses a decision tree model for classification. Scales input data for accurate predictions. Provides an output prediction with a user-friendly interface. Technologies Used:  Python pandas, numpy scikit-learn (joblib for model loading) Decision Tree Classifier
